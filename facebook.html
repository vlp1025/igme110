<h1>Facebook's commitment to privacy 2018 Trial</h1>

<p>In 2018, Facebook's CEO had to declare in front of US congressmen and congresswomen regarding the web page's commitment in respecting their user's private information.
    This trial reminded web pages of the consequences that exist if a web page does not protect the private information of their user's or uses their information without their consent.
    These consequences may be fatal for any company that misuses user's private information, with losses valued in billions of dollars. Many web pages updated their privacy settings 
    after the conclusion of this trial, an example of this can be the social web page called "Twitter".
