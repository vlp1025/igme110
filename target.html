<h1>Target Stores Breach 2013</h1>

<p>In 2013, Target Stores suffered a considerable breach in which their constumers' private data has been leaked towards an unkown hacking 
    organziattion. This data included credit card information, their CVV (cards identification value), the card expiration's date and the costumers' names.
    In other words, all of their payment information was leaked towards the breachers, and that information could have been used without their consent.
    Target legally paid 18.5 million dollars to the states affected and offered compenssation to the affected costumers.
